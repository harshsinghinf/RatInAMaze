## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/harshsinghinf/RatInAMaze.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
Copy code
   ```bash
    cd RatInAMaze
3. Open index.html in Your Browser
4. Simply double-click the index.html file.
5. Alternatively, use a live server extension if you're using a code editor like VSCode.

##Usage
Select a Level

Use the dropdown menu to choose a maze level (Level 1 to Level 5).
Navigate the Rat

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the rat:
Arrow Up (‚Üë): Move up
Arrow Down (‚Üì): Move down
Arrow Left (‚Üê): Move left
Arrow Right (‚Üí): Move right
Goal

Guide the rat from the starting position to the cheese without hitting walls.
Win the Game

Upon reaching the cheese, a "You Win" modal will appear.
Switch Levels

Change the level anytime by selecting a different option from the dropdown menu. Click on the maze a few times after changing the level to regenerate it.

##BackTracking Visualization
**Load Game Mode**

Click the "Load Game" button to access an alternative game mode with additional controls:
Start: Begin the algorithmic visualization.
2x, 3x, 4x: Adjust the speed of the algorithm's exploration.
Reset: Restart the game and visualization.

**Levels**
Each level presents a unique maze layout designed to challenge your navigation skills and visualize the backtracking process:

Level 1: Simple maze with minimal walls.
Level 2: Intermediate maze with more obstacles.
Level 3: Complex maze with intricate pathways.
Level 4: Advanced maze with multiple dead-ends.
Level 5: Expert-level maze with the highest difficulty.

**Gameplay Instructions**
Starting the Game: The rat begins at a predefined starting point (marked by the rat image).
Movement: Use the arrow keys to move the rat one cell at a time.
Walls: Avoid walls (black cells) as the rat cannot pass through them.
Winning: Reach the cheese (marked by the cheese image) to win the game.
Level Switching: Select a different level from the dropdown to change the maze layout.
Load Game Mode: Access additional controls for algorithm visualization speed and resetting the game.
Backtracking Algorithm Visualization
One of the standout features of RatInAMaze is its ability to visualize the Backtracking Algorithm in real-time as the rat navigates through the maze. This visualization serves as an educational tool, helping users understand how backtracking systematically explores all possible paths to find a solution.

**Visualization Controls**
Start Button: Initiates the backtracking visualization, allowing the algorithm to begin solving the maze automatically.
Speed Controls:
2x: Doubles the speed of the visualization for faster exploration.
3x: Triples the speed, providing an accelerated view of the algorithm's process.
4x: Quadruples the speed for the fastest possible visualization.
Reset Button: Stops the ongoing visualization and resets the maze to its initial state, allowing users to restart the algorithm from the beginning.
Visualization Features
Real-Time Path Exploration:
Yellow Cells: Indicate the current path being explored by the algorithm.
Green Cells: Highlight the successful path leading to the cheese.
Red Cells: Mark the paths that were explored but did not lead to a solution.
Dynamic Rat Movement: The rat image moves through the maze, following the algorithm's decisions step-by-step.
Interactive Speed Adjustment: Users can adjust the visualization speed on-the-fly to better observe the algorithm's behavior.
Reset Functionality: Easily restart the visualization to see different paths or to understand the algorithm's decision-making process from scratch.


**How It Works**
Starting Point: The rat begins at its starting position in the maze.
Exploration: The backtracking algorithm explores all possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current position.
Dead Ends: If the rat hits a wall or a previously visited cell, the algorithm backtracks to the last valid position and tries a different path.
Path Highlighting:
Yellow Cells: Indicate the current path being explored.
Green Cells: Mark the successful path leading to the cheese.
Red Cells: Show the paths that were explored but did not lead to a solution.
Real-Time Updates: As the algorithm progresses, you'll see the rat moving through the maze, with cells changing colors to reflect the algorithm's decisions.
Final Outcome:
Success: If a path to the cheese is found, the successful path is highlighted in green.
Failure: If no path exists, an alert notifies the user that no path is available.
Educational Insights
Understanding Backtracking: By watching the rat explore and backtrack, users can grasp the fundamental principles of the backtracking algorithm, such as recursion, exploration of all possibilities, and systematic backtracking upon encountering dead ends.

Algorithm Efficiency: The visualization demonstrates the time complexity of backtracking, especially how it can become exponential with increasing maze complexity.

Practical Applications: Learn how backtracking is applied in various domains like puzzle solving (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queen problem), pathfinding, and decision-making processes.

Example Visualization
